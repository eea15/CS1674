1. For which of the three representations is the within-between ratio smallest?
The BOW with k=5 has the smallest ratio (Ratio for BOW k=10: 0.375394).

2. Does the answer to this question depend on the value of k that you use?
Yes; when the value of k=2 the lowest ratio is actually texture mean (Ratio for texture mean: 0.563118).

3. Does it depend on the number of keypoints you extract? (Try 500, 1000, 2000, 3000.)
Yes, as the number of keypoints increases, the ratios for BOW change:

Top 500 keypoints:
Ratio for BOW k=2: 0.944239
Ratio for BOW k=5: 0.394857
Ratio for BOW k=10: 0.375394
Ratio for BOW k=50: 0.426348
Ratio for BOW k=100: 0.441640
Ratio for BOW k=200: 0.432668
Ratio for texture concat: 0.942568
Ratio for texture mean: 0.563118

Top 1000 keypoints:
Ratio for BOW k=2: 0.580675
Ratio for BOW k=5: 0.386737
Ratio for BOW k=10: 0.354680
Ratio for BOW k=50: 0.367120
Ratio for BOW k=100: 0.403516
Ratio for BOW k=200: 0.384978
Ratio for texture concat: 0.942568
Ratio for texture mean: 0.563118

Top 1500 keypoints:
Ratio for BOW k=2: 1.165606
Ratio for BOW k=5: 0.346804
Ratio for BOW k=10: 0.347342
Ratio for BOW k=50: 0.367656
Ratio for BOW k=100: 0.380025
Ratio for BOW k=200: 0.367653
Ratio for texture concat: 0.942568
Ratio for texture mean: 0.563118

4. Which of the three types of descriptors that you used is the best one? How can you tell?
The ratio for BOW k=5 and abover works the best because it consistently produces the smallest within-between representation. This means it better differentiates between images.

5. Is this what you expected? Why or why not?
Yes, I expected the BOW representation to work best because it is flexible to things like geometry viewpoint.
