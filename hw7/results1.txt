plt1_times =

The combined pyramid representation had the most accuracy in test predictions because pyramids tend to perform the best as opposed to single-level representations (they have more robust training input).
The level 0 representation performed better than the level 1 representation because with strong features, single-level representation accuracy declines after a certain point.
