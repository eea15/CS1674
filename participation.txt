Emma Akbari (eea21) Participation Notes

Throughout this semester, I participated in a few different ways. First, I answered a question in class about every other week. Additionally, I attended about 4 office hour sessions (with both you and the TA). Finally, I answered 2 other students' questions in Piazza (hw2 and hw3).
