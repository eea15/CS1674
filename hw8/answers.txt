Q: Then, in a file answers.txt, say which weight matrix is the best one, (1) according to the hinge loss, and (2) according to the cross-entropy loss.

A:
Program output: 
h =

    1.3144    0.0288    6.9304    6.9834
    0.4269    2.6964    0.8951    6.6308
    6.4296    0.6867    3.9775    1.9734


c =

    0.9792    0.4496    3.0090    2.7701
    0.6986    1.4628    0.8632    2.5973
    2.3537    0.8717    1.6831    1.1818

  (1) W2 is the best matrix, with an average loss of 1.1373.
  (2) W2 is still the best matrix, with an average loss of 0.9280.
